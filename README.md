Created with Gemini to see how much it could do to show a globe in a browser that displays the current location of the ISS

TODO
- add button to click to change through various views
- ISS should be a more realistic size
- ISS altitude should be realistic
- add day/night display
- show the sun when appropriate

Views
1. Cinematic
- have it show the ISS on the top right, and the globe under it, similar to the Universal movie opening

2. ISS Centric
- Show globe centered on the screen, but ISS is stationary on the center of the screen, and globe spins under it
